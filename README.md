plugin concept:
regular arrow keys do steering, gas, brake
Holding A or D gradually builds up steering
-> tap D quickly to steer 50%
-> shorter taps for less percent steering
-> longer taps for more percent steering

I think this is a more skill based way to enabled analog steering on keyboard when compared to action keys. For me right now it's about as good in bobsleigh/water bounce as controller, however i'm not trained with this plugin, nor am i good with controller.
